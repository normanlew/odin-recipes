# odin-recipes
This is a recipe website

In this project I practiced:

1.  Setting up a repository on Git Hub and cloning it to my local machine in Mac OS Terminal
2.  Created an index.html file with links to individual recipe pages
3.  Created individual recipe pages that contained a picture of the food along with ingredients and cooking instructions using ordered and unordered 
lists.
4.  Practiced git commands to stage, commit, and push my code changes.
