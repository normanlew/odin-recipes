            <h2>A Simple Dal Recipe</h2>
            <p>This is an easy recipe for dal, a classic Indian dish!</p>
            <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup masoor dal</li>
                <li>3 1/2 cups water</li>
                <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
                <li>1 cup onions finely diced</li>
                <li>3 tbsp neutral oil</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp cumin seed</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp mustard seed</li>
                <li>1 jalepeno seeded and finely diced</li>
                <li>1 large tomato you want summer tomatoes for this</li>
                <li>3 tbsp cilantro minced</li>
                <li>1 tsp kosher salt – you want to use about half this much table salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
           <h4>Making the Dal</h4>
           <ol>
                <li>Combine the lentils, water, whole garlic cloves and turmeric.</li>
                <li>Bring to a simmer, reduce heat and cover. The order matters. Bringing
                the pot to a boil when covered gets incredibly messy. Trust me. 
                I've done it. More than once.</li>
                <li>Cook until the lentils have disintegrated. Stir them along the way 
                to prevent them from sticking. You want lentil mush. Like a sauce almost. 
                If you can see a whole lentil you need to cook them some more. 
                This should take about 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
           </ol>
           <h4>Making the Final Flavoring</h4>
           <ol>
                <li>Do this while your lentils cook if you're pressed for time.</li>
                <li>Heat a not too big skillet over medium low heat. Add the oil. 
                When the oil starts to shimmer add the onions. Sweat the onions, 
                stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent. This takes around 5 minutes or so.</li>
                <li>Toss in the diced jalapeño and cook for another minute.</li>
                <li>Add the cumin seed and mustard seed. This is the tricky part. 
                You want the oil to form little bubbles around the seeds. See them all move just a little. 
                Like a whole spice rave in the pan. Let the spices party for about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Toss in the tomato and the cilantro and continue cooking until the tomato is just warmed through.</li>
                <li>Fold the mixture into the dal. Add the salt. Taste. You are going to need more. 
                Creep up on the salt profile that works for you.</li>
                <li>Serve as a side dish with tandoori chicken or the curry of your choice. 
                Or serve it as a main with an Indian flatbread. I'm in heaven with this dal and a paratha or chapati.</li>
           </ol>
